# Introduction

The problem - getting PHP scripts live on Amazon Web Services.

The solution - declarative formats for automation.

# Ansible

"App deployment, configuration management and orchestration." - Ansible.com

Ansible is a command-line tool written in Python. It has lots of modules and
great documentation. Ansible scripts are called playbooks. Playbooks are lists
of commands stored as YAML data files.

One great thing about playbooks is that they are just text files, so you can
keep them under source-control, along with your app.

# Example

In this repository the *setup.yaml* playbook has two parts. First, it provisions
an EC2 Linux server. Then, it installs packages and uploads a PHP script.

When the playbook provisions your Linux server it also configures the networking
rules (including an elastic IP) and installs your SSH public-key. This is all
specified in the *cf.json* file (the CloudFormation manifest).

Running the playbook again won't make it provision a new server, it will just
check that your original server is still running and correctly configured.

Similarly with the server's packages, if Apache is already installed then it
won't try to reinstall it. The *setup.yaml* playbook is a checklist of sorts.

# Usage

Install Python2 using your package manager, then install pip using easy_install,
then install Ansible and Boto using pip.

  {brew|port|apt-get|yum|pacman} install python2
  easy_install pip
  pip install ansible boto

Create a new keypair by logging in to the AWS management console and uploading
the public-key you normally use for SSH (probably ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub). Give it a
name and then put that name in the *parameters.yaml* file. I called mine *mbp*
for MacBookPro.

To communicate with the AWS API, Ansible uses a library called Boto. You will
need your AWS credentials in your ~/.boto file. You should be able to find them
in the AWS management console too. See the boto wiki for more information:
http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html.

Check the config options in parameters.yaml and then...

  ansible-playbook setup.yaml

The first run might take a few minutes. If there are any errors then just try it
again. You can see which resources are being created in the AWS management
console. Cleaning up is easy because all the resources are created as a single
CloudFormation. Have a look in the CloudFormation section of the management
console and you'll see what I mean.

### Notes

Requires: Ansible ~v1.7.
